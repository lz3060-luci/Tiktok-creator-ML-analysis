# Tiktok-creator-ML-analysis
Machine learning analysis of TikTok creator profiles using text mining and tree-based models
This project investigates whether profile-level textual and behavioral features
encode sufficient signal to predict TikTok creator visibility in the absence
of video-level content.

## Methods
- Text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model comparison using ROC-AUC and accuracy

## Key Findings
- Engagement metrics are the strongest predictors of high-follower status
- Bio text provides additional predictive signal
- Tree-based models outperform linear models

## Files
- notebooks/: analysis notebooks
- report/: final project report
